# 06_Philosophy – Index

## Contents

## Purpose
Provide navigable links to all child notes and surface gaps.

## Questions
- What files are missing or need consolidation?
- Are cross-lane links explicit and MECE?
- Which items should be prioritized for recursion?

## Next Steps
- Add missing notes.
- Normalize metadata across children.
- Link to related lanes where dependencies exist.
