summary: |
  The corpus must capture Dale's metaphorical, musical, and analogical voice as
  a first-class signal, not just factual shards. Expressions such as "things dats
  undastood don't need no splaining" or "beg so much his hands look like cups"
  should be routed into a dedicated Voice lane or dual-captured alongside literal
  shards. These entries will be tagged, indexed, and linked to the Voice Guide,
  ensuring style preservation and preparing training data for LoRA adapters that
  enforce tone, rhythm, and analogy.
