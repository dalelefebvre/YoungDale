# 01_Preferences – Index

## Contents (with summaries)

## Purpose
Provide navigable links and brief summaries for rapid retrieval and gap detection.

## Questions
- Which files lack Purpose sections or clear claims?
- Where are cross-lane dependencies not explicit?
- What should be prioritized for recursion this week?

## Next Steps
- Add missing Purpose/Claims.
- Normalize metadata and links.
- Schedule evaluator passes for novelty, ethics, and consequence.
