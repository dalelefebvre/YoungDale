# Creation Tuning

## Notes
- AI system generates across domains (culinary, design, apps, poetry).
- Each creation teaches the system new structural insights.
- Novelty may lie in recursive feedback loop from creative outputs back into architecture.

## Questions
- How is multi-domain creation itself patentable?
- What feedback mechanisms are unique compared to existing generative systems?

## Purpose
Explain why this block exists and how it connects to other lanes.

## Notes
Capture rough ideas, fragments, or context.

## Questions
- What atomic files should live here?
- How do they link to other folders?
- What provenance anchors are required?

## Claims
(Optional) Assert testable statements.

## Next Steps
Define what should be done next with this block.
