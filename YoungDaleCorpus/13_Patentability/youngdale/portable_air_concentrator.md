# Portable Air Concentrator Patent Idea

## Notes
- Device runs for ~4 hours on battery power.
- Designed to minimize jetlag by improving oxygenation and rest quality.
- Not medical grade → potential for cheaper, smaller, consumer-focused design.
- Patentability may lie in:
  - Architecture or shape of the filter.
  - Efficiency of battery usage.
  - Portable form factor optimized for travel.
  - Novel use case: jetlag mitigation rather than medical therapy.

## Questions
- What prior art exists in portable concentrators?
- How do we differentiate from medical-grade devices?
- What claims can cover filter architecture, portability, and consumer use?
- What markets (aviation, travel wellness) are most relevant?

## Purpose
Explain why this block exists and how it connects to other lanes.

## Notes
Capture rough ideas, fragments, or context.

## Questions
- What atomic files should live here?
- How do they link to other folders?
- What provenance anchors are required?

## Claims
(Optional) Assert testable statements.

## Next Steps
Define what should be done next with this block.
