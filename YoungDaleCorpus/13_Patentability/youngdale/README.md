# YoungDale Patentability

## Purpose
This folder holds rough notes, fragments, and structured outlines about how YoungDale’s architecture,
recursive mentor loops, and shouldness engine could be patentable.

## Questions
- What aspects of YoungDale are novel compared to existing AI systems?
- Which components (corpus ingestion, recursive rewrite, provenance logging, shouldness engine) are patentable?
- What prior art should be scanned first?
- How do we structure claims to cover both technical and creative outputs?
