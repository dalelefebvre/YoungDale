# YoungDale definition

## Purpose
Define YoungDale as a recursive mentor system that unifies technical, creative, and product domains, with provenance and sponsor-grade governance.

## Architecture
- **Recursive mentor loop:** ingestion → retrieval → critique → rewrite → provenance → update.
- **Shouldness engine:** cadence + criteria that decide what should be done next.
- **Corpus-first:** atomic, YAML-rich Markdown; indices; manifests; evaluators.
- **Personalization:** philosophy claims, canon/media adapters, rules, consequential decisions.

## Operational lanes
- **Reasoning (night):** patentability, philosophy, ethics, brand.
- **Coding (night):** repo refactors, feature additions, harnesses.
- **Frontier recursion (Ultra 512G):** long-context analysis, multi-agent planning.
- **Benchmarking (Sparks 2×, 128G each):** comparative agent runs, fallbacks.

## Patentability hooks
- **Creation tuning:** learning from outputs to alter architecture.
- **Recursive assessment:** patentability of the system assessing itself.
- **Philosophy training:** experiences, consequences, relationships canon.
- **Canon/media adapters:** curated sources shaping style and decisions.

## Questions
- **Novelty:** Which components are patentable independently?
- **Governance:** Where are autonomy bounds and rollback rules?
- **Consequence:** How do outcomes shape evaluation and next actions?

## Next steps
- **Evaluator library:** Define scoring criteria for novelty, ethics, recursion.
- **Manifest discipline:** Encode resource use and quality targets per lane.
- **Provisional filings:** Sequence conceptual patents ahead of product patents.
