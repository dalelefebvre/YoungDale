# Summary
A living guide for Dale's voice: metaphor, simile, musical phrasing, rhythm, and analogy.

## Patterns
- **Metaphor:** "She was the feeling before a smile."
- **Simile:** "Beg so much his hands look like cups."
- **Music:** Off-beat cadence, internal rhyme, repetition.
- **Analogy:** Everyday objects carrying ethical weight.

## Capture rules
- **Atomic lines:** One shard per line; no dilution.
- **Dual capture:** Voice shard + backlink to source note.
- **Backlinks:** Always link to [[voice/index]] and [[voice/guide]].
- **Tags:** [Voice, Metaphor, Simile, Music, Analogy].
