# Patentability Roadmap

## Conceptual Patents (Corpus-driven)
- [[creation_tuning.md]] → AI tuned to create across domains (recipes, furniture, apps, poetry).
- [[recursive_assessment.md]] → Recursive evaluation of patentability itself.
- [[speed_vs_quality.md]] → Quality-first tuning over efficiency/cost.
- [[philosophy_training.md]] → Training AI on philosophy architecture (experiences, consequences, relationships).
- [[canon_training.md]] → Media-based canon training (YouTube, archetypes, rules).
- [[rules_and_life_decisions.md]] → Training AI on personal rules and consequential decisions.
- [[ethics_autonomy.md]] → Ethics-first AI design.
- [[brand_module.md]] → Recursive brand governance.

## Product Patents (At-scale)
- [[portable_air_concentrator.md]] → Portable, battery-powered air concentrator for jetlag mitigation.

## Prioritization
1. **Corpus patents first** → Establish novelty in recursive mentor loops, training methods, and philosophy-driven AI.
2. **Product patents second** → Pursue portable air concentrator once scale and resources allow.
3. **Integration patents** → Link corpus-driven methods with product innovations (e.g., AI-guided design of concentrator filters).

## Milestones
- **Short-term (0–12 months):** File provisional applications for conceptual patents.
- **Mid-term (12–24 months):** Develop prototypes for product patents (air concentrator).
- **Long-term (24+ months):** Consolidate into a portfolio of 100+ patents across corpus + product domains.

## Questions
- Which conceptual patents are most defensible against prior art?
- What resources are needed to file product patents at scale?
- How do we integrate corpus patents with product patents into one coherent IP strategy?

## Purpose
Explain why this block exists and how it connects to other lanes.

## Notes
Capture rough ideas, fragments, or context.

## Questions
- What atomic files should live here?
- How do they link to other folders?
- What provenance anchors are required?

## Claims
(Optional) Assert testable statements.

## Next Steps
Define what should be done next with this block.
