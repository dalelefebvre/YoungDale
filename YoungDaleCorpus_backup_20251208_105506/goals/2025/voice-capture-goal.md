# Summary
Ensure metaphorical, musical, and analogical expressions are captured as first-class shards.

## Rationale
Style carries meaning. Capturing voice lines preserves rhythm, tone, and ethical weight.

## Plan
- Atomic capture of voice lines as shards.
- Dual-link shards to their source notes.
- Build LoRA-ready datasets from tagged shards.

## Links
- Voice Guide: [[voice/guide]]
- Voice Index: [[voice/index]]
- Poetry: [[poems/index]]
- Reflections: [[journals/index]]

## Next steps
- Seed 10 voice shards today.
- Wire CLI listener to append shards automatically.
