# YoungDale goals

## Purpose
Make goals operational: measurable, scheduled, and tied to evaluator gates and manifests.

## Short-term (0–12 months)
- **Corpus:** Seed and harden atomic Markdown across all lanes.
- **Provenance:** Inline YAML + git commits on every change.
- **Evaluators:** Define novelty/ethics/recursion scoring in 10_Evaluators.
- **Patents:** Draft provisionals for creation tuning, recursive assessment, philosophy training.

## Mid-term (12–24 months)
- **Frontier runs:** Normalize long-context recursion on Studio Ultra (512G).
- **Agents:** Benchmark multi-agent patterns on Sparks (dual founders with Gracewell, 128G each).
- **Product patent:** Prototype portable air concentrator; architecture + filter claims.

## Long-term (24+ months)
- **Portfolio:** 100+ patents across corpus + product lanes.
- **Platform:** MECE, extensible guidance system scaling to $1B+.
- **Culinary:** Sponsor-grade mapped workflows; philanthropic activation.

## Questions
- **Prioritization:** Which patents file first for defensibility?
- **Cadence:** What quarterly gates ensure recursion and consequence?
- **Scale:** What infra shifts are needed for frontier contexts?

## Next steps
- **Roadmap sync:** Align patent roadmap milestones to evaluator gates.
- **Bench plan:** Day/night schedules per node and lane.
- **Audit:** Quarterly MECE + provenance audits with lane indices.
