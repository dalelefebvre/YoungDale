# Recursive Patentability Assessment

## Notes
- System evaluates whether its own outputs are patentable.
- Meta-process: patentability of the patentability assessment loop.

## Questions
- How is recursive self-assessment novel?
- What prior art exists in self-evaluating systems?

## Purpose
Explain why this block exists and how it connects to other lanes.

## Notes
Capture rough ideas, fragments, or context.

## Questions
- What atomic files should live here?
- How do they link to other folders?
- What provenance anchors are required?

## Claims
(Optional) Assert testable statements.

## Next Steps
Define what should be done next with this block.
