# Editor & CLI Preferences

## Scribe-retary Behavior
- Intake app appends ideas to 00_Index/inbox.md with timestamp and provenance.
- Route to lanes deterministically when offline; semantically when AI is available.
- Cross-link related lanes using embeddings when available.

## Notes
- Codify deviations explicitly in Notes with rationale.

## Next Steps
- Add evaluator hints to YAML during intake.
- Sync these preferences into .vscode/settings.json via a small script.
